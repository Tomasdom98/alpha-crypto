<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build and refine a full-stack crypto intelligence platform, Alpha Crypto.

Initial requests for the overall project included a codebase audit, removal of Sanity.io, creation of a MongoDB-backed admin panel, fixing API issues, and general UI/UX improvements.

Recent requests in this session focused on enhancing the user experience and visual polish:
1.  **Full-Site Internationalization (i18n):** Ensure all user-facing text (buttons, labels, paragraphs) is fully translatable between English and Spanish.
2.  **Dynamic Data Connection:** Connect the public-facing Portfolio page to the backend so that data managed in the admin panel (Yields, Staking, Portfolio Value) is displayed dynamically.
3.  **Professional Design Refresh:** A complete visual overhaul of the entire application, including the admin panel, to match the aesthetic of modern high-tech platforms like Jupiter, Solana, and Vercel. This included a new color palette, glassmorphism, better typography, and animations.
4.  **Owl Help Menu:** Enhance the floating owl mascot to be a clickable menu with options for the AI assistant and a new support contact form.
5.  **Floating Hero Icons:** Add subtle, animated decorative icons to the background of the homepage's hero section to enhance the high-tech theme.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The user communicates primarily in Spanish, although some technical requests are in English. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for crypto intelligence. The platform has undergone a significant professional redesign, featuring a dark mode, glassmorphism effects, a new emerald/cyan color palette, and improved typography and animations across all pages, including a Vercel-style admin panel. The internationalization (i18n) system has been fully implemented and verified, making the site bilingual (EN/ES). The Portfolio page is now fully dynamic, fetching data (Total Value, Yields, Staking) directly from the MongoDB backend, which is manageable via the password-protected admin panel. A new help menu has been added to the floating owl mascot, which includes a support contact form that sends emails via Resend.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user asked if the Admin Panel's design was also improved and requested the link (). The agent confirmed it was and was in the process of taking a screenshot to prove it.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Agent has already performed extensive screenshot testing on the admin panel redesign and confirmed it works).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. Take a screenshot of the logged-in admin dashboard to show the user the new design.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: User Verification for Admin Panel Redesign (P0)**
  - **Description**: The user needs visual confirmation that the admin panel redesign was successfully implemented.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    1.  Provide the user with the link to the admin panel: .
    2.  Provide the password: .
    3.  Use the  to capture an image of the logged-in admin dashboard () to show the professional new design.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To confirm completion of the user's request and close the loop on the design refresh task.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?**: N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (via screenshot).
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

- **Issue 2: Implement Real Protocol Logos (P1)**
  - **Description**: A recurring request to replace placeholder images on pages like Airdrops and Portfolio with actual logos for the protocols and tokens.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    1.  Ask the user to provide URLs for the logos or find them via web search.
    2.  Update components like  and  to use the new logo URLs, likely passed from the backend.
    3.  If the logo URL is not in the DB model, update the corresponding Pydantic models in  and the  forms to allow admins to add/edit logo URLs.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fulfills a long-pending user request and significantly improves UI professionalism.
  - **Status**: NOT STARTED
  - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

- **Issue 3: Resend Domain Verification (P2)**
  - **Description**: All email functionality (support form, newsletters, alerts) is blocked because the user has not verified their domain ( or similar) in their Resend account. The new support form will fail to send emails until this is done.
  - **Next debug checklist**: This is a user action. The agent must inform the user to log into their Resend account and follow the steps to verify their sending domain.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Enables all email-related features to function correctly.
  - **Status**: BLOCKED (on user action)
  - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Backend (by testing the support form endpoint).
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **Improve Admin Authentication (P2):** Replace the simple hardcoded password with a more secure login mechanism (e.g., JWT-based auth with a user model).
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **Full Premium Tier Integration (P2):** Implement Stripe payments for premium access.
  - **Push/Email Notifications (P3):** Implement a system for user alerts.
  - **Admin Panel for Newsletter (P3):** Create a UI for the admin to manage and send newsletters.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Site Internationalization (DONE):** Completed and verified translations for all remaining pages (, , , etc.) using the .
- **Dynamic Portfolio Connection (DONE):** Refactored  to fetch all data (Total Value, Returns, Holdings, Strategy Notes, Yields, Staking) from the backend  endpoints.
- **Professional Design Refresh (DONE):** Executed a complete UI/UX overhaul across the entire application, including the Admin Panel, based on user-provided design specifications and inspiration from sites like Vercel and Jupiter.
- **Owl Help Menu (DONE):** Replaced the simple Owl mascot with a component that opens a menu with AI Assistant and Help options.
- **Support Contact Form (DONE):** Created a glassmorphism-styled modal for support requests, which submits to a new  backend endpoint.
- **Floating Hero Icons (DONE):** Added subtle, animated crypto and tech-themed icons to the homepage hero background for decorative effect.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- See All Pending/In progress Issue list: Implement Real Protocol Logos and Resend Domain Verification.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** Maximum call stack size exceeded Babel error.
  - **Recurrence count:** 3
  - **Status:** RESOLVED. The consistent fix is to refactor large JSX files into smaller, modular components. This pattern should be followed if the error reappears.

**Code Architecture**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **¡La tarea prioritaria (P0) es responder al usuario!** El usuario preguntó si la página de Admin fue rediseñada. Debes tomar un screenshot del dashboard de  (contraseña: ) y mostrárselo para confirmar que el rediseño está completo y luce profesional.
- **El idioma principal es el español.** Asegúrate de comunicarte en español.
- **El rediseño visual está completo.** La base del nuevo look & feel está implementada. Las próximas tareas de frontend deben adherirse a los nuevos estilos definidos en  (glassmorphism, gradientes, etc.).
- **El envío de correos está bloqueado.** La nueva función de contacto de soporte (y cualquier otra función de correo) no funcionará hasta que el usuario verifique su dominio en Resend. Debes recordárselo.
