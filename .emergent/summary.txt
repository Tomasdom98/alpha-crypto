<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack crypto intelligence platform called Alpha Crypto. The platform should have a dark, professional, and dynamic theme, providing free educational content (Alpha Research), verified airdrop information, and real-time market data.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Content:** All content under Alpha Research must be high-quality and render markdown correctly.
- **Data Integrity:** All market data must be connected to live, free APIs (DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, Alternative.me).
- **ALPHA-I Assistant:** An AI chat assistant, ALPHA-I, accessible via a modal with a prominent button in the header.
- **UI/UX:**
    - The UI must be fully bilingual (Spanish/English) with a language selector in the header. User preference should be saved in .
    - The navigation bar should be split into Free and Premium sections to guide users. Airdrops is a premium feature.
    - The ALPHA-I button must be visually distinct and prominent in the navigation bar.
    - The Portfolio page needs internal navigation tabs (Portfolio, Yield Stablecoins, Staking).
    - The  brand component should have subtle animations.
- **Features:**
    - **Portfolio Page:** Must include sections for Yield Stablecoins and a new Staking section with static data for SOL, ETH, BTC, and SUI.
    - **Airdrops Page:** Should display verified airdrops without difficulty or premium badges. Search and filtering by blockchain are required.
    - **Alpha Research Page:** The page, formerly Articles, should have search and category filtering.
    - **Premium Modal:** Must include a toggle for Monthly / Annual pricing with corresponding discounts. The discount should be clearly communicated in both views.
    - **Macro Calendar:** A new page displaying important market events (e.g., FOMC, CPI) with a visual calendar and filters.
    - **Logos:** Add official logos for all protocols listed in the Airdrops and Yield Stablecoins sections.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish only.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Frontend:** A fully responsive, bilingual (ES/EN) application with a dark theme. The  is implemented across all pages and components. Key pages include Homepage, Alpha Research, Airdrops, Market Indices, Portfolio, and Macro Calendar. The Premium Modal's pricing logic and layout have been updated to clearly show annual discounts.
- **Backend:** A FastAPI server provides real-time market data from external APIs, mock data for airdrops and articles, and endpoints for the ALPHA-I assistant.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user requested a complete audit of the codebase. The agent was in the process of gathering information by reviewing backend and frontend files (,  files,  directory, etc.) to prepare the report.
    - The user's request for the audit includes:
        1. An API dependencies report (Free vs. Paid vs. Mock).
        2. A breakdown of data sources for each tab/page.
        3. A list of files/code that can be cleaned up or deleted (e.g., Sanity.io related).
        4. A list of all required environment variables for production.
        5. A summary of what is broken or incomplete.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N/A (This is an analysis task)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** N/A
- **User Testing Done:** N/A

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Codebase Audit (P0)**
  - **Description**: The user has requested a comprehensive audit of the codebase to plan the next steps, including cleanup and connecting remaining mock data. The previous agent started gathering information but did not complete the report.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
      1.  Consolidate the information gathered from ,  files, and the file system.
      2.  Analyze  to map out all external API calls (CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, etc.) and identify all hardcoded/mock data sources (articles, airdrops, calendar events).
      3.  Identify all Sanity.io related files (, ) for deletion.
      4.  List all environment variables from  and .
      5.  Structure all findings into the five specific sections requested by the user.
      6.  Present the complete audit report to the user for approval.

    - **Full Premium Tier Integration (P2):** Implement Stripe payments for the premium tiers.
    - **Push/Email Notifications (P3):** Implement a system to alert users about important calendar events or new airdrops.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Site Language Translation (DONE):**
  - Completed the internationalization (i18n) feature, making the entire application bilingual (Spanish/English).
  - Translated all remaining pages and components: , , , , , .
  - Passed a full test suite from the testing agent, confirming 100% success.
- **Premium Modal Enhancement (DONE):**
  - Updated the  to show the potential annual savings even when viewing monthly prices, as requested by the user.
  - Fixed the modal's layout to ensure the Monthly/Anual toggle and all pricing information are visible without scrolling on a standard viewport.
- **Babel Crash Bug (RESOLVED):**
  - Fixed a recurring Maximum call stack size exceeded error from Babel by refactoring and simplifying the JSX structure in  and .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Issue 1: Resend Domain Verification**
     - **Debug checklist**: This is not a code issue. Inform the user that to enable email functionality (forms, newsletters), they must verify their domain in their Resend account settings.
     - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: This blocks all email functionality from working in a production environment.
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Backend (by triggering an email send after user confirmation).
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
   - **Issue 2: Implement Real Protocol Logos**
     - **Debug checklist**: The user provided URLs for logos in a previous session. These need to be added to  and the Yield Stablecoins section in .
     - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Fulfills a pending user request and improves the UI's professionalism.
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Frontend.
     - **Is recurring issue?**: N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** Maximum call stack size exceeded Babel error.
  - **Recurrence count:** 2 (Once in , once in this session with  and ).
  - **Status:** RESOLVED. The fix involves simplifying complex JSX components and moving large static objects (like translation maps) outside the component's render function. This is a key pattern to follow if the error reappears.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **La tarea más importante es completar la auditoría del código solicitada por el usuario.** Debes presentar un informe claro que responda a los cinco puntos que el usuario especificó. Esta es la máxima prioridad (P0).
- **El error de Babel Maximum call stack size exceeded es un riesgo recurrente.** Si ocurre, la solución es refactorizar componentes JSX grandes y complejos en subcomponentes más pequeños y mover objetos estáticos grandes (como las traducciones) fuera del cuerpo de la función del componente.
- Después de la auditoría, las siguientes prioridades son eliminar el código de Sanity.io y reemplazar los logos placeholder con las imágenes reales.
