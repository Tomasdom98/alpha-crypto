<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack crypto intelligence platform called Alpha Crypto with a dark, professional, and dynamic theme inspired by The Milk Road. The platform aims to provide free educational content and premium features. The user provides iterative feedback on design, content, and functionality, expecting the agent to implement changes in prioritized batches.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Content Overhaul:** Make all articles free, add category tags (e.g., AI, Stablecoins), and rewrite them in a more dynamic, engaging Milk Road style with updated data, sections, and relevant images/graphics. A specific PDF on stablecoins was provided for one article.
- **Airdrops Verification:** Analyze and correct the steps provided for each airdrop to ensure they are accurate and actionable.
- **Email Integration:** Connect the existing feedback and consulting forms to an email service so that submissions are sent to the user's email address.
- **Branding:** Establish a strong visual identity using a provided logo and owl mascot. The branding should be professional, technological, and consistently applied across the entire site.
- **Data Integrity:** Fix the unreliable live price ticker and eventually replace mock data in charts with live data from real APIs (e.g., DefiLlama).
- **Language:** The entire user-facing application must be in Spanish.
- **Domain:** The user inquired about using the custom domain  after deployment.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The user provides all instructions in Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish only.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Backend:** A FastAPI server () with endpoints for content, market data, and user submissions. Content is fetched from Sanity CMS, with extensive mock data in  as a fallback. An in-memory cache using  has been implemented for the CoinGecko API endpoints (, ) to mitigate severe rate-limiting issues.
- **Frontend:** A React application styled with Tailwind CSS. The entire UI has been translated to Spanish. A professional branding has been established, featuring a text-based logo () in the navigation/footer and a reusable  component that displays an owl mascot as a fixed brand seal on every page. Major pages include Homepage, Articles, Airdrops, Market Indices (with sparklines and new large-format charts), and premium pages.
- **CMS:** Sanity.io (Project ID: ) is the primary source for articles, airdrops, and signals.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent began a major content overhaul based on the user's latest request. It successfully parsed a user-provided PDF for a stablecoin article and then completely rewrote the  function in . This new function returns article data in a much richer, Milk Road-inspired format, with sections, updated information, and category tags, and removes the premium flag. The agent was about to start verifying the airdrop data next.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both. The frontend () needs significant updates to render the new rich content from the backend. This will require using the **frontend testing agent** or extensive manual testing with the **screenshot tool**. For the Airdrops verification, the agent will need to do research and manually review the steps.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: CoinGecko API Rate Limiting (P0)**
  - **Description**: The backend server is still frequently blocked by CoinGecko's API (), causing the live price ticker to fall back to cached or mock data. The caching system has improved stability but does not solve the root cause.
  - **Attempted fixes**: Added  header, error handling, and most recently, a server-side caching layer.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
      1.  Review .
      2.  Investigate and implement a secondary, free API (e.g., CoinCap, CryptoCompare) as a fallback when CoinGecko fails.
      3.  For the large charts on the  page, investigate integrating the DefiLlama API to replace mock data, as suggested by the user.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The live price ticker is a core feature. A reliable data source is crucial for the platform's credibility.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Content and Feature Overhaul (P0)**
  - **Description**: This is the main ongoing task initiated by the user's last detailed message.
  - **Where to resume**:
      1.  **(Frontend) Update Article Rendering:** The backend now provides articles in a new rich format. The next critical step is to modify  to correctly parse and display this new structure (e.g., render sections, images, tables, styled quotes).
      2.  **(Backend/Research) Verify Airdrop Steps:** Review the airdrop data in . Research each airdrop to confirm the steps are accurate and actionable, then update the data accordingly.
      3.  **(Frontend) Add Category Tags:** Update  to display the new category tags for each article.
  - **What will be achieved with this?**: This will fulfill the user's request for higher-quality, more engaging content, significantly improving the platform's value proposition.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
  - **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **Email Service Integration (P1):** The user explicitly asked to connect their email for the feedback and consulting forms. This requires using the  subagent to integrate a service like Resend or SendGrid and updating the backend logic in .
    - **Real Data for Large Charts (P1):** Fulfill the user's request to connect the new large charts on the  page to a real API like DefiLlama to replace the current mock data.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **Dynamic Owl Animations (P2):** The user expressed interest in making the site more dynamic. An enhancement would be to add subtle animations to the  component (e.g., on hover or scroll).
    - **Search/Filter Functionality (P2):** Add a search bar to the articles page and filter options to the airdrops page.
    - **Custom Domain Explanation (P3):** Inform the user that adding a custom domain () is a post-deployment step managed through the Emergent platform's dashboard, not a task for the agent.
    - **Automatic On-chain Payment Verification (P3):** Automate the verification of premium subscription payments.
    - **Restructure for Next.js (P3):** A long-term technical goal to migrate the project from CRA/FastAPI to a Next.js framework.

**Completed work in this session**
- **UI/UX Verification:** Verified UI changes for the Airdrops page (educational intro) and Market Indices page (sparkline charts).
- **CoinGecko API Caching:** Implemented an in-memory caching system in , which stabilized the live price ticker.
- **Branding and Visual Overhaul:** Went through multiple iterations to establish the site's visual identity. This included:
    - Replacing initial image logos with a clean, text-based logo ().
    - Creating a reusable  component to display a professional owl mascot seal consistently on all pages. The seal's design was refined multiple times based on user feedback.
- **Full-Site Spanish Translation:** Translated all UI text across the entire React frontend to Spanish.
- **Large Market Charts:** Added a new section to  with large  graphs for key market metrics.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** Maximum call stack size exceeded Babel error.
- **Recurrence count:** 0 (in this session).
- **Status:** RESOLVED. This remains a potential risk for future complex JSX components but did not occur during this job.
